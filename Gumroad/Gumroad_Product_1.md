## 📝 Product Description (Copy-Paste)

### **Title**
The Indie Playlister Starter Pack (1,000 Verified Targets)

### **Headline**
**Humans make music. Bots check data.**
Stop pitching your music to dead links and confused playlists.

### **Body**
You are great at making music. You shouldn't be wasting your studio time doing data entry.

We built a custom bot ecosystem to scan thousands of playlists, verifying the artists and genres so you don't have to. We usually sell the full database to labels and managers, but we want independent artists to see the power of clean data for free.

**This is the "Starter Pack."**
We didn't just give you the "pop" lists. We used a **Stratified Sampling** algorithm to pull 1,000 playlists that cover *every single genre* in our database—from Indie Folk to Death Metal to Lo-Fi.

**📂 What you get for $0:**
* **15 Verified Curators** (With real contact info).
* **1,000 Verified Playlists** (A diverse mix of all genres).
* **The "Focus Score"** (Our proprietary metric for playlist quality).

**🎯 What is the "Focus Score"?**
This is the column that saves you the most time.
* **High Score (Green):** The playlist is focused. (e.g., A Country playlist that actually contains Country songs). **Pitch here.**
* **Low Score (Red):** The playlist is a mess. (e.g., A "Rock" playlist filled with random bot-pop). **Skip this.**

**🚀 Why is this free?**
Because we know that once you see how much time this saves you, you'll want the full **Complete Curator Database** (5,800+ Playlists). But start here. Test the waters. Send your first 50 pitches tonight.

**⚠️ A Note on Automation:**
While we make every effort to be accurate, **these are bots doing the work.** Algorithms lack human intuition. If a playlist looks like a great fit in the data, click the link and check the vibe before you pitch.
