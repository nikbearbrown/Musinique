## 📝 Product Description (Copy-Paste)

### **Title**
The Complete Curator Database (5,800+ Verified Playlists)

### **Headline**
# Humans make music. Bots check data.
Your time is worth more than $5/hour. Stop doing manual data entry.

### **Body**
You could spend the next 6 months manually searching for playlists, clicking broken links, and guessing if a curator is active... or you could download the answer key right now.

**🤖 The Problem: Impossible Math**
Verifying a playlist's quality requires checking the genre of every artist on it.
To do this manually for 5,800 playlists would take a human **~1,450 hours** (that's 36 weeks of full-time work).

**🚀 The Solution: Bot-Powered Speed**
We built a custom bot ecosystem to do the heavy lifting for you.
* **We scan the artists:** We verify the actual genre of the music on the list, not just what the title says.
* **We calculate the metrics:** Our proprietary "Focus Scores" tell you instantly if a playlist is a tight genre fit or a messy mixtape.
* **We fight entropy:** Data rots. Curators change names and links break. We use automation to capture a fresh snapshot of the music landscape *right now*.

**🔮 The Roadmap: This Is Just The Start**
We are building a living database, not a static list. Our bots are scheduled to re-scan these playlists every single week.
* **Coming Soon (Churn Data):** We are gathering data on how often playlists add or remove songs. Eventually, we will be able to tell you which lists are "stable" and which ones churn through tracks too fast.
* **More Metrics:** We are constantly training our bots to find new data points that the big services hide. By buying now, you are supporting independent data research.

**📂 What you get in this download:**
* **84 Verified Playlisters** (The Gatekeepers with contact info).
* **5,800+ Playlists** (The Inventory).
* **Deep Metrics:** Focus Scores, Reach, and Last Updated dates.
* **Clean Format:** A ready-to-use CSV file. No code required.

**🎯 What is the "Focus Score"?**
This is the column that saves you the most time.
* **High Score (Green):** The playlist is focused. (e.g., A Country playlist that actually contains Country songs). **Pitch here.**
* **Low Score (Red):** The playlist is a mess. (e.g., A "Rock" playlist filled with random bot-pop or Heavy Metal). **Skip this.**

**⚠️ A Note on Automation (Please Read):**
While we make every effort to be as accurate as possible, **these are bots doing the work.** We process thousands of data points to give you the best possible starting point, but algorithms lack human intuition.
* **Our Advice:** If a playlist looks like a great fit in the data, **click the link and take a look for yourself.**
* **The Workflow:** Use our database to filter down from 5,000 to the best 50 matches, then use your human ears to make the final call.
