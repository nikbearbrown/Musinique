## 📝 The Script & Storyboard

| Time | Visual Action | Audio (Voiceover) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** | **[Visual: Joni Puppet (File A)]**<br>Static shot. Slow push in. She looks concerned. | **"You wrote a beautiful acoustic Folk song. So why is it on a playlist next to... Death Metal?"** |
| **0:06** | **[Visual: Headphone Guy]**<br>Quick cut. Animate him slightly shaking his head (left/right) or just zoom out quickly. | **"Because that 'Folk' playlist has a Focus Score of 12. It's a mess."** |
| **0:12** | **[Visual: Screen Recording]**<br>Mouse hovers over a **RED** score (12). Then clicks/scrolls to a **GREEN** score (92). | **"We calculate a Focus Score for every playlist. High means it's pure. Low means it's a kitchen sink."** |
| **0:20** | **[Visual: Joni Puppet (File B)]**<br>Cut to the version of her holding the guitar. She looks content/ready. | **"Don't throw your music into the void. Use the Focus Score to find a safe home."** |
| **0:25** | **[Visual: Text Card]**<br>Black background. White text.<br>**Verified Focus Scores. $25.** | **"The Complete Curator Database. Verified by bots. Link in bio."** |

## ✂️ Editing Notes
* **Vibe:** This one should be slower and more atmospheric than the Prince ad.
* **Music:** Use a stripped-back acoustic guitar track (Indie/Folk vibe) that cuts out abruptly at **0:06** when the "Death Metal" line drops, then resumes at **0:20**.
* **Text Overlays:**
    * At **0:12**, overlay text: **"FOCUS SCORE: 12 (BAD)"** in Red.
    * At **0:15**, overlay text: **"FOCUS SCORE: 92 (GOOD)"** in Green.
