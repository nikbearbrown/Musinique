## 📝 The Script & Storyboard

| Time | Visual Action | Audio (Voiceover) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** | **[Visual: Prince Puppet]**<br>Slow zoom in on the puppet's face. He looks annoyed/bored. | **"Humans make music. Bots check data."** |
| **0:05** | **[Visual: Headphone Guy]**<br>Hard cut to the close-up. Maybe a slight camera shake to emphasize urgency. | **"A bad playlist claims to be 'Indie Rock,' but it's full of random junk."** |
| **0:10** | **[Visual: Headphone Guy (Continued)]**<br>Keep the same shot or flip it horizontally for variety. | **"To spot the fake, you have to verify the genre of *every single artist* on the list."** |
| **0:15** | **[Visual: Screen Recording]**<br>The CSV file scrolling rapidly. Rows blurring by. Highlight the 'Genre' column. | **"That takes 15 minutes per list. To verify 5,800 playlists, it would take you 1,450 hours."** |
| **0:22** | **[Visual: Prince Puppet]**<br>Cut back to Prince. He taps his foot (animate a simple rotation or just zoom out). | **"We built a bot to do the math... so you can play the music."** |
| **0:27** | **[Visual: Text Card]**<br>Black background. White text.<br>**$25. Link in Bio.** | **"The Complete Curator Database. Verified by bots. Download it now."** |
